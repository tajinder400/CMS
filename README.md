This is my disseration, which attempts to show the possibilities of using a client management system on your mobile.
It does this by sending SQL requests from the Android Client towards the Server application. The server application
processes this request and parses the data from the database into an XML file.
This XML file is the sent back to the Android Application which is then used to display data on the device.
This process allows the ability to add, delete and ammend files on the database.
